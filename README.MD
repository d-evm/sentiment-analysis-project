# Sentiment Analysis Project

This repository contains code and resources for performing sentiment analysis on movie and flight reviews. The project demonstrates the use of various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to classify text data.

## Project Overview

### Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis
The `movie-reviews-sentiment-analysis.ipynb` notebook contains code to process and analyze movie reviews. The project aims to classify the reviews into positive or negative sentiment categories using machine learning models.

### Flight Reviews Sentiment Analysis
The `flight-review-sentiment-analysis.ipynb` notebook focuses on analyzing sentiment from flight reviews. The objective is to categorize reviews into positive, negative or neutral sentiments based on the provided text.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stop word removal, and vectorization techniques (e.g., CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer).
- **Model Training**: Implementation of various machine learning models, including logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and support vector machines (SVM).
- **Evaluation**: Includes model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks:
   - Open `movie-reviews-sentiment-analysis.ipynb` or `flight-review-sentiment-analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
   - Execute the cells to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate the results.
